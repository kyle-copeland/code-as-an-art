# code-as-an-art
A list of resources between the overlap of code and art. I'm interested using art as a framework for understanding coding. Art's been with us since the beginning of time and is a much more mature substance. Coding's only been around for > 100 years and is just starting to form. I've almost left the field of computer science because I didn't see much life in it. I've since then been convinced that there is much life to be had, we just need to shine a light on it. This notepad is an attempt to do that.

## The gaps between the culture of code and art
1. We don't have means of being inspired by other "coders." What does a poet do when they need inspiration? They go to an art exhibit, read a piece of literature, go for a walk, take a hot bath. They read the canon of poets who laid the groundwork of their creative outlet. Most of these elements are already available to us, but we don't have others' code to look at to be inspired.

2. Our history is rather dispersed. We need more historians in our field--telling the stories that haven't been told. How are we to learn from our past without know what our past was. What are the "eras" of coding? What are the mistakes we've made? What were our failures and triumphs? Why do we write code the way we do today? Why is our industry dominated by white males?

3. We see coding mostly as a utility. Our field was developed post Industrial Revolution and has breathed its air since it was born. We need to wedge software out of its utility and see it also as a form of expression and truth telling.
